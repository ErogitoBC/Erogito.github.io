## Welcome To My Project Show Case
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout this github web page you will find the project I worked on during my CS 499 Capstone class. Each one will come with a description as well as a link to the repository
where it is being held.

# Professional Self-Assessment
###### Start of assessment

## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###### Using java and application development I was able to define my previous to-do list application with a spalsh screen, rewrite feature and delete feature to exapand on my Java knowledge. The link for this respective piece of work can be found at my personal [To-do list Repository](https://github.com/ErogitoBC/BizzyBeeEventTracker).

## Enhancement Two: Algoritms and Data Structure 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###### Using what I've learned throughout the class I was able to design a website for a faux travel company. The original work was done in Java but I decdided creating a website would help me learn a lot more about web development. The full code can be found at my [SNHU travel site repository](https://github.com/ErogitoBC/SnhuTravelsite).

## Enhancement Three: Databases
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###### Using advanced python techniques alongside newly learned skills in MongoDB I was able to create a stock summary feature for my mongodb project. The code for the project can be found at my personal [Python code repository](https://github.com/ErogitoBC/PythonMonDB)
